ChatGPT has received significant interest from scientists across various disciplines, including water science. While not originally designed for a specific task, ChatGPT has demonstrated satisfactory performance in a wide range of applications. This paper focuses on evaluating the reliability of ChatGPT 4.0 specifically in the context of flood susceptibility mapping. Our approach involved reviewing approximately 100 key articles published after 2013, which detail developments in modeling and identify existing gaps in the field. We posed the same questions addressed in these papers to ChatGPT and compared the responses with the insights extracted from the reviewed articles. This comparative analysis aims to establish the extent to which ChatGPT is a reliable tool for flood susceptibility mapping.
